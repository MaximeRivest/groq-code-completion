IMPORTANT: Extension Fix for "groq-sdk not found" error

The previous version was missing the bundled dependencies.
This new version includes all dependencies bundled inside.

To fix:
1. Uninstall the old extension in VSCode
2. Install this new groq-code-completion-0.1.0.vsix file
3. Restart VSCode

The extension now includes:
- All npm dependencies bundled (including groq-sdk)
- Automatic activation on VSCode startup
- No need to install npm packages separately

The extension should work immediately after installation!
